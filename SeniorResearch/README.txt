This Directory is for Ian Davidson's Senior Capstone Project At SSU spring 2019.

Timeline of what Ive done. I will organize my events with respect to directories in project.

Before semeseter started.
       Looked at some research papers in Fall 2018
       Familiarized myself with the definitions around density of regular language.
       Decided on a specific research paper to use.
       	       "Efficiently computing the density of regular languages"


Late January:
       Tried to work through the algorithm presented named compute period


Early/mid Feb:
	  Program named reccurence.py contains the iterative O(mnk) algorithm for computing the sequence of convirgence probability from 1 to n, for every state.
	  I also have a recursive solution which is 0(n^2), and not currently being used in main().
	    	 Thinking about if there is a good way to print out the long sequences of convergence values for states in provided dfa. Maybe graph library? Matplotlib

	  (not completed yet)Program computeDensity.py contains the following algorithms: "Finding SCC", "compute period", "compute limit"
	       Steps that need to happen.

Period3:
	Implemented multiple different ways using a recurrence formula
