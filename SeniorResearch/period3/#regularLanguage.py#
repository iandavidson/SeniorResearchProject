#Goal of this file:
    #1 Start with an instance of a dfa.
        #i. Find it's strongly connected components done.
    #2 Create adjacency list for each subchain induced by each SCC/terminal component.
        #i. I was thinking of making a class for each subchain or make subchains members of DFA class.
    #3 Use subchains to run through algorithms Compute-Limit and Compute-Period.
